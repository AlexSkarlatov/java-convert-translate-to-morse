 * I know i gave this a stupid name but that was more out of recent
 * frustration with setting this up in general but the purpose of this is just a basic
 * exersise in translation of morse code to english and then encrypting
 * it with a basic ceesar cypher i want this project to be able to do all of that 
 * so right now this silly .java file will serve as the base for all the basic logic as a sort of testing ground and impl
 * implementing it cleanly will be the job of the other file  in this class
